# Matildas-Touch
An Arduino Based project, utilising the IMU and the BLE capabilities of the Arduino. Through this, I built a program that listens for three actions by the "master" Arduino device- yaw, pitch and roll. From this, the slave device will activate three different actions- either pulling the blinds up and down in a room, dimming a lightswitch and opening/closing a door
